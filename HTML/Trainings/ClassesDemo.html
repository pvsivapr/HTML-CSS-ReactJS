            <b><u>Prototype</u></b>
            Prototype is a object, where it will have its own functions.
            It is a way of inheriting something.
            All JavaScript objects inherit properties and methods from a prototype:
            <ul>
               <li>Date objects inherit from Date.prototype</li>
               <li>Array objects inherit from Array.prototype</li>
               <li>Person objects inherit from Person.prototype</li>
            </ul>
            The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype inheritance chain:
            Date objects, Array objects, and Person objects inherit from Object.prototype.

            
        </p>
        <p>
            <b><u>__proto__</u></b>
            likewise "prototype" is a blueprint, Where __proto__ is the actual object, which executes.
            "__proto__" is the actual object that is used in the lookup chain to resolve methods. It is a property that all objects have. This is the property which is used by the JavaScript engine for inheritance.
