           <ul>
               <li>Both can be used for same functionality."</li>
               <li>This works as a asynchronous function</li>
               <li>Callback has to write a lot of code and everything has to be handled by developer</li>
               <li>Promise needs less code and also callback methods are handled by Promise, but the promise object should handled positive response by ".then"
                   and negative by ".catch" blocks
